#summary Getting help with using the audioboo API

= Support =

== Mailing Lists ==
As mentioned on the [StartPage Start Page] you should subscribe to the Audioboo [http://groups.google.com/group/audioboo-api-discuss Discussion] & [http://groups.google.com/group/audioboo-api-announce Announcements] google groups, and the discussion list should be your first port-of-call with any problems. At a minimum the audioboo devs _should_ also be subscribed to this list.

*Make sure you search for existing open discussions on the same topic before starting a new thread*

== Issue Tracking ==
If you think there's something wrong with our server - post an Issue on the google-code page. This way we can track it, ask questions and solicit feedback.

*As with the group, make sure you search and comment on any existing issues before rasing a new one*

== Email == 
If all else fails, try getting hold of the developers directly. For support relating to the API, your best point of contact is probably thomas (at) bestbefore (dot) tv.

== Security Issues ==
We would appreciate that any security concerns or issues are *NOT* initially discussed in public. If you have a security issue to raise, please contact the email addresses directly in the first instance.
Whilst we try to run AudioBoo in an entirely transparent fashion, we'd appreciate the chance to fix any serious security issues before they become widely known or exploited.

Rest assured that we _will_ document and credit the discovery of any security issues we receive and explain action we have taken to remedy the situation once it's no-longer exploitable.
